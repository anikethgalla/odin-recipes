    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish featuring wide, flat sheets of pasta layered with rich fillings.</p>
    <p>It typically includes a meaty ragù sauce, creamy béchamel, and cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan.</p>
    <p>Originating from Emilia-Romagna, it's assembled in multiple layers and baked until golden and bubbly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wide lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Ground beef (1 lb), Italian sausage (½ lb), onion, garlic, crushed tomatoes (28 oz), tomato paste (6 oz)</li>
        <li>Ricotta (15 oz, mixed with 1 egg and parsley), mozzarella (4 cups shredded), Parmesan (1 cup grated)</li>
        <li>Basil, oregano, salt, pepper, fennel seeds, parsley</li>
        <li>Olive oil, optional béchamel (milk, butter, flour)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Meat Sauce:
            Brown 1 lb ground beef and ½ lb Italian sausage with diced onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat until cooked through (about 10 minutes). Drain fat, then stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and fennel; simmer for 1-2 hours to develop flavors.</li>
        <li>Make Ricotta Filling
            Combine 15 oz ricotta cheese with 1 beaten egg, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix until smooth. Set aside. Grate 1 cup Parmesan and shred 4 cups mozzarella.</li>
        <li>
            Assemble Lasagna
            Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread 1 cup meat sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3-4 lasagna noodles, ricotta filling, meat sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Repeat 3-4 times, ending with noodles, sauce, and cheese on top.
        </li>
        <li>Bake and Rest
        Cover with foil and bake 25 minutes; uncover and bake 25 more minutes until bubbly and golden. Let rest 15-20 minutes before slicing to set layers.</li>
    </ol>
